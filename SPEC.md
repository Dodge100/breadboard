## 5. Part Four: Shortcuts & AppleScript Integration

- ❌ **No Shortcuts trigger source**: Breadboard events cannot trigger Shortcuts automations
- ❌ **No two-way integration**: Shortcuts cannot read or modify Breadboard state
- ❌ **No AppleScript dictionary**: No scripting interface for external app integration
